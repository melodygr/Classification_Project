    ">The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides that \n",
    ">>[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n",
    ">  \n",
    ">The ultimate goal of this provision is to protect people’s right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable intrusions by the government. However, the Fourth Amendment does not guarantee protection from all searches and seizures, but only those done by the government and deemed unreasonable under the law.\n",

    ">In the case of Terry vs Ohio, decided on June 10, 1968, by the United States Supreme Court, Terry and two other men were observed by a plain clothes policeman in what the officer believed to be \"casing a job, a stick-up.\" The officer stopped and frisked the three men, and found weapons on two of them. Terry was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon and sentenced to three years in jail.\n",
    ">  \n",
    ">In an 8-to-1 decision, the Court held that the search undertaken by the officer was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment and that the weapons seized could be introduced into evidence against Terry. Attempting to focus narrowly on the facts of this particular case, the Court found that the officer acted on more than a \"hunch\" and that \"a reasonably prudent man would have been warranted in believing [Terry] was armed and thus presented a threat to the officer's safety while he was investigating his suspicious behavior.\" The Court found that the searches undertaken were limited in scope and designed to protect the officer's safety incident to the investigation.\n",

    ">A Terry stop in the United States allows the police to briefly detain a person based on reasonable suspicion of involvement in criminal activity. Reasonable suspicion is a lower standard than probable cause which is needed for arrest. When police stop and search a pedestrian, this is commonly known as a stop and frisk. When police stop an automobile, this is known as a traffic stop. If the police stop a motor vehicle on minor infringements in order to investigate other suspected criminal activity, this is known as a pretextual stop.\n",

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    ">A terry stop is another name for stop and frisk; the name was generated from the U.S Supreme Court case Terry v. Ohio. When a police officer has a reasonable suspicion that an individual is armed, engaged, or about to be engaged, in criminal conduct, the officer may briefly stop and detain an individual for a pat-down search of outer clothing. A Terry stop is a seizure within the meaning of Fourth Amendment.\n",
    ">  \n",
    ">In a traffic stop setting, the Terry condition of a lawful investigatory stop is met whenever it is lawful for the police to detain an automobile and its occupants pending inquiry into a vehicular violation. The police do not need to believe that any occupant of the vehicle is involved in criminal activity.\n",
    ">  \n",
    ">In a recent case, Floyd v. City of New York 813 F. Supp.2d 417 (2011), the court held the New York stop-and-frisk policy violated the Fourth Amendment because it rendered stop and frisks more frequent for blacks and Hispanics.\n",

But I wonder if it is possible that by a subject NOT identifying themselves (i.e. Subject ID = -1), they could be more or less likely to be arrested.  Same concern about Subject IDs that have many repeat encounters... maybe they are more or less likely to be arrested.  I'm considering binning the info somehow... into 'unidentified', 'first encounter', 'repeat encounter'. Does the officer know it is a repeat encounter if it happened with a different officer?"

This model won't be used to predict future cases of Terry Stops, it is just to analyze past decisions.  Therefore, I think the most important metric will be accuracy.
